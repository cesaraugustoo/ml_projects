# Linear Regression

## Introduction
This project demonstrates the implementation of a basic linear regression model, a foundational statistical method used to model relationships between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. The goal of this project is to predict outcomes and understand the relationships in data, with an example focusing on predicting house prices based on features such as area, number of rooms, and location.

### Assumptions of Linear Regression
1. **Linearity**: The relationship between predictors and the outcome is linear.
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of errors across values of independent variables.
4. **Normality**: Residuals (errors) are normally distributed.
5. **No multicollinearity**: Independent variables should not be highly correlated with each other.

### Why Use Linear Regression?
Linear regression is widely used due to its simplicity, interpretability, and efficiency in predicting continuous outcomes. It is the foundation for more complex regression methods and machine learning algorithms.

## Algorithm Pseudocode
The linear regression process can be outlined as follows:

```
1. Load the dataset.
2. Preprocess the data:
   a. Handle missing values.
   b. Normalize or scale features if necessary.
   c. Encode categorical variables if present.
3. Split the data into training and testing sets.
4. Train the model on the training set:
   a. Initialize weights and bias.
   b. Use gradient descent to minimize the loss function (Mean Squared Error):
      i. Compute predictions: Y_pred = X * weights + bias.
      ii. Calculate the error: error = Y_pred - Y_actual.
      iii. Update weights and bias using the gradient of the error.
5. Validate the model on the testing set:
   a. Compute predictions for the testing data.
   b. Evaluate performance using metrics (e.g., R-squared, RMSE).
6. Generate predictions for new input data.
7. Visualize results and model performance.

## Results

The linear regression model provides the following results:

- **Coefficients**: Indicate the impact of each feature on the target variable.
- **Model Performance**:
  - High R-squared values indicate a strong fit.
  - Low RMSE values indicate high accuracy.

### Interpreting the Output
- A positive coefficient suggests that an increase in the feature increases the target variable.
- A negative coefficient suggests an inverse relationship.
